# Day-89-Community-Chat-
I Made a functioning community chat web app that has normal users as well as an admin user that can delete chats, this has been the toughest project I have had so far mainly because the method wanted via the Replit course was to use their built in functionality mainly the authentication however I didnt want to use that so I built user logins
