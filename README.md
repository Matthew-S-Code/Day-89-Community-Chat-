# Day-89-Community-Chat-
I Made a functioning community chat web app that has normal users as well as an admin user that can delete chats, this has been the toughest project I have had so far mainly because the method wanted via the Replit course was to use their built in functionality mainly the authentication however I didnt want to use that so I built user logins and an admin login, also I had to use another database so i used sqlite via copilot walking me through how to use and implement, I had to use copilot for alot of my help in other aspects as well because the course solution youtube video went in a different connection and the solution code on replit didnt work so I didnt have those resources which made things much harder
